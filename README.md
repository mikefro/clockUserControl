# clockUserControl
 Implementing an alarm clock using the UserControl Class with C #


This project is about creating and using personalised controls. 
You can find information on the personalised user controls and Events on the below links.

[UserControl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.usercontrol?view=netframework-4.7.2)
[Events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/event) 
[Raise and consume Events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/events/how-to-raise-and-consume-events)

In this case I have created a digital clock with an alarm that raises an event where user functions can be added by the programmer. See below screen shot of the User Control:

## Properties and characteristics of the Digital Clock

The Digital Clock has the following additional features:
- Boolean Format24hours; to set 12 or 24 hours as time format (djfgkjg)
- Alarm feature: for this to activate it is characterised by an hour and a minute. The User Control takes care of building the Alarm object.
- Features the event Alarm Activated where you can add the desired functions when the alarm is turned on.

## Support and new input
